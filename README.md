## Comments

There is alot I would like to do with this. My ideas for this site were a bit more than I could chew in two weeks...but The front and backend were built in that time and somewhat rushed and since i'm new to using any of the above mentioned for the backend...I took a bit more time on that than I would have wanted but once I get some free time it will be a stunning site.

Feel free to contact me if you have any ideas, comments, concerns :)
